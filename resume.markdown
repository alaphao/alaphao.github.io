## Experience

### Airtasker

From **30 August** **2017** to **28 February 2020**

Working as **iOS** **Software** **Engineer**

**Summary**

Airtasker is a trusted community platform that connects people who need to outsource tasks and find local services, with people who are looking to earn money and ready to work.

At Airtasker, I worked for two years on a product team focused on business projects. I took part in the whole process, from ideation to deployment. However, my primary responsibility was to deliver features to the iOS app under pressure and tight deadlines.

Later I joined the platform tooling team. A team focused on developing and maintaining tools to enhance other engineers' productivity. While on this team, I worked on a few projects not related to iOS and had the responsibility of being an ambassador for the iOS team, raising platform and tooling related issues.

Besides my primary responsibilities, I always put in the extra effort to make sure the iOS app and the team kept getting better. The two most impactful things were leading the codebase migration to a reactive paradigm, and creating automated code generation pipelines.
