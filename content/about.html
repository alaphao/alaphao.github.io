  <p>Hello!</p>
  <p>
    I'm Aleph Retamal. Developer, designer, and entrepreneur.
  </p>
  <p>
    I started coding when I was very young (4 years old! ðŸ‘¶). Since then, I have been self-taught in many different subjects. Learning new things and coding are two of my biggest passions. You can learn more about my skills by running the <span class="funcname" data-link="resume">resume</span>() function.

    In the past, I've done game developing, web applications, mobile applications, and other cool things in all sort of platforms. You can check some of my code on my <a href="https://github.com/alaphao" class="cname" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.

  <p>
    Currently my primary focus is on iOS Development with Swift, but I'm always doing something for the web too. I'm also spend a lot of time studying Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies. I have done a couple of Ethereum contracts and tools to interact with these contracts on iOS. Machine Learning and Information Security are two other topics that I'm also very interested in.
