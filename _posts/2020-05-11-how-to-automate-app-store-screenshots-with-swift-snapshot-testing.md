{% assign assets_path = "/assets/posts/appstore_screenshots" %}

You finished your app, and now you have to take screenshots for your app's page on App Store. Your app supports many languages and devices, so you decided to automate this task. The only tool you heard about is [fastlane snapshot](https://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/snapshot/), and you decided to try it.

Since snapshot uses [XCUITest](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/testing_with_xcode/chapters/09-ui_testing.html), you create a UI Test and try to write some code that will get you to the screen you want, with the data you want. After some time, you realise that it's harder than you thought. Stubbing data is hard and intrusive. The test is fragile. 

Can't I just instantiate my View Controller with precisely the data I want and then take a screenshot of it? Well, the answer is yes, but you'll have to let go of XCUITest.

In this tutorial, we'll use the snapshot testing library [pointfreeco/swift-snapshot-testing](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-snapshot-testing.git) to take screenshots of our app and make them ready for [fastlane deliver](https://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/deliver/) to use.

### Getting Started

Download or clone the starter project [here](https://github.com/alephao/tutorial-appstore-snapshot). Open `MyAwesomeApp.xcworkspace`, then build and run the `MyAwesomeApp` scheme.

The starter project contains only one screen, the GreetingView. This screen shows a label with the text `Hello, <username>`. We get the username from  `UserDefaults`, but if we can't find any, then we use the word `Anonymous` instead. The app contains translations for en-US, en-AU, pt-BR, and es.

<div style="text-align: center; margin: 30px 0;">
  <img src="{{ assets_path }}/app-screenshot-simulator.png" alt="app-screenshot-simulator" width="231" style="box-shadow: 0 0 5px #ccc;">
</div>

There are two targets in this project: an application target and a dynamic framework target. The app target only contains the `AppDelegate.swift`, `SceneDelegate.swift`, and some supporting files. The dynamic framework is where everything else lives. It includes the views, business logic, localized strings, and some helpers.

To control effects from the outside world, we are using the Service Locator pattern explained [here](https://vimeo.com/291588126). To handle localized strings, we're using some ideas from the [kickstarter/ios-oss](https://github.com/kickstarter/ios-oss) project, the [Language.swift](https://github.com/kickstarter/ios-oss/blob/d88e9c0c6e9bfafe0006da7e67091afddbec8d3a/Library/Language.swift#L4) and [LocalizedString.swift](https://github.com/kickstarter/ios-oss/blob/) files.

There is a playground file `MyAwesomeApp.playground` that renders the GreetingView in the playground live view. Change the `language` variable to `.pt` and check the results in the live view. You can also try different values for the `userDefaults`.

Now that you're familiar with the app, let's get started.

### Creating the Screenshots Target

First we need to create the test target that will run our Snapshot tests:

1. Open `MyAwesomeApp.xcworkspace`. 
1. Select **File ▸ New ▸ Target...**. 
1. Choose **Unit Testing Bundle**. 
1. Name it **AppStoreScreenshots**. 
1. For the **Target to be Tested** box, select **MyAwesomeAppFramework**.
1. Click **Finish**.

![add-unit-testing-bundle]({{ assets_path }}/add-unit-testing-bundle.png)

### Adding the Snapshot Library

We have our test target ready, now let's add the swift-snapshot-testing library. We will be using Swift Package Manager in this tutorial.

1. Select **File ▸ Swift Packages ▸ Add Package Dependency..**.
1. Paste this URL in the textfield: `https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-snapshot-testing.git`.
1. Click **Next** twice.
1. Select the **AppStoreScreenshots** target.
1. Click **Finish**.

![add-snapshot-lib]({{ assets_path }}/add-snapshot-lib.png)

### Adding a Snapshot Test

Now we are ready to start taking our screenshots, so let's jump straight to it. Open `AppStoreScreenshots.swift` and add the following import statements:

```swift
import MyAwesomeAppFramework // Access to GreetingView
import SnapshotTesting // Access to the snapshot library
import SwiftUI // Access to UIHostingController
```

To take a screenshot of the GreetingView, create a new test `testScreenshots()` and add the following lines of code:

```swift
func testScreenshots() throws {
  record = true // 1
  let view = GreetingView() // 2
  let vc = UIHostingController(rootView: view) // 3
  assertSnapshot(matching: vc, as: .image(on: .iPhoneXsMax)) // 4
}
```

1. We always want to record new screenshots, so we need to set `record = true`.
1. Creating an instance of the view that we want to take a screenshot.
1. The snapshot library can't take a snapshot of a SwiftUI view directly, so we need to embed it in a UIHostingController.
1. We use the `assertSnapshot` function with the `.image` strategy to take a screenshot. Since I want a screenshot for a 6.5-inch phone, I'm using the `.iPhoneXsMax` view.

And that's it. You have your first screenshot test. Run the test with `Cmd+U` and it should generate a png file in this directory:

```
<PROJECT_ROOT>/AppStoreScreenshots/__Snapshots__/AppStoreScreenshots/
```

The test works, but it's not very reliable because if we change the language of the simulator, or if we previously changed the value of `UserDefaults`, we'll get a different result. To confirm this, select **Edit Scheme ▸ Test ▸ Options** and change the **Application Language** to **Portuguese (Brazil)**. Now rerun the tests with `Cmd+U` and you'll see that the new screenshot is generated in Portuguese.

### Overriding the Environment

Since we're using the Service Locator pattern, we can force the view to render with a specific language by overriding the global environment. Let's create a function for that.

```swift
func withEnvironment(
  _ env: MyAwesomeAppFramework.Environment,
  body: @escaping () -> Void) {
  let oldEnv = AppEnvironment.shared.env
  AppEnvironment.shared.env = env
  body()
  AppEnvironment.shared.env = oldEnv
}

func withEnvironment(
  userDefaults: UserDefaults = AppEnvironment.shared.userDefaults,
  language: Language = AppEnvironment.shared.language,
  body: @escaping () -> Void) {
  let env = Environment(userDefaults: userDefaults, language: language)
  withEnvironment(env, body: body)
}
```

This method runs a snippet of code with a specific environment. It's similar to the code inside `MyAwesomeApp.playground`. If you haven't explored the playground yet, go ahead and give it a try.

Now we can wrap the contents of our test in this function to override the global environment:

```swift
func testScreenshots() throws {
  record = true
  let userDefaults = UserDefaults() // 1
  withEnvironment(userDefaults: userDefaults, language: .enUS) {
    let view = GreetingView()
    let vc = UIHostingController(rootView: view)
    assertSnapshot(matching: vc, as: .image(on: .iPhoneXsMax))
  }
}
```

Now the screen will always be rendered with `.enUS` and the device language will be ignored.

### Generating All the Screenshots

We want to generate screenshots for all supported languages, iPhone-6.5 inch and iPhone-5.5 inch. To get all the possible combinations, we can loop through all languages and devices and then take the snapshot. Add the following snippet to your test, before the `withEnvironment` call:

```swift
let languages: [Language] = [.enAU, .enUS, .es, .pt] // 1
let devices: [ViewImageConfig] = [.iPhoneXsMax, .iPhone8Plus] // 2
```

1. The languages we want to iterate through.
1. The devices we want to iterate through. `ViewImageConfig` is a type from the swift-snapshot-testing library. It contains information about the screen frame and safe area.

Let's update our test to loop through all values and take the snapshot.

```swift
for language in languages {
  for device in devices {
    withEnvironment(userDefaults: userDefaults, language: language) {
      let view = GreetingView()
      let vc = UIHostingController(rootView: view)
      assertSnapshot(matching: vc, as: .image(on: device))
    }
  }
}
```

Rerun the tests and you should have eight screenshots generated inside the `__Snapshots__` folder.

```
└── __Snapshots__
    └── AppStoreScreenshots
        ├── testScreenshots.1.png
        ├── testScreenshots.2.png
        ├── testScreenshots.3.png
        ├── testScreenshots.4.png
        ├── testScreenshots.5.png
        ├── testScreenshots.6.png
        ├── testScreenshots.7.png
        └── testScreenshots.8.png
```

Unfortunately, the names of the files aren't helpful. If we want to use something like [deliver](https://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/deliver/) to upload the screenshots, we need to separate them by language. Let's tackle this issue in the next section.

### Saving Screenshots in Fastlane Directory

Deliver looks for the app screenshots on `<PROJECT_ROOT>/fastlane/screenshots/<LANGUAGE>`. So, our next goal is to save the screenshots there.

The first thing we need to do is to get access to the path to **fastlane** in our `AppStoreScreenshots.swift` file. To get access to the path, we'll inject an environment variable through the `AppStoreScreenshots` scheme by following these steps:

1. Edit the `AppStoreScreenshots` scheme and navigate to `Test ▸ Arguments`. 
1. Uncheck the `Use the run action's arguments and environment variables` checkbox. 
1. Add an environment variable with the key `FASTLANE_SCREENSHOTS_PATH` and value `$(SOURCE_ROOT)/fastlane/screenshots`.
1. On `Expand Variables Based On` select `AppStoreScreenshots`. We need this to expand the `$(SOURCE_ROOT)` variable.

![config-test-env-vars.png]({{ assets_path }}/config-test-env-vars.png)

Now we can access the value of `FASTLANE_SCREENSHOTS_PATH` via `ProcessInfo.processInfo.environment["FASTLANE_SCREENSHOTS_PATH"]`. Let's go back to `AppStoreScreenshots.swift` and force the snapshot library to save the screenshots there.

The `assertSnapshot` function doesn't provide us with a way to choose the directory where the file will be saved. To save the files in a different directory, we'll have to use the `verifySnapshot` function instead. Add the following snippet to `AppStoreScreenshots.swift`:

```swift
func saveScreenshot(
  matching value: UIViewController,
  as snapshotting: Snapshotting<UIViewController, UIImage>,
  dir: String,
  file: StaticString = #file,
  testName: String = #function,
  line: UInt = #line
  ) {
  let snapshotDirectory = ProcessInfo.processInfo.environment["FASTLANE_SCREENSHOTS_PATH"]! + "/" + dir

  let failure = verifySnapshot(
    matching: value,
    as: snapshotting,
    record: true,
    snapshotDirectory: snapshotDirectory,
    file: file,
    testName: testName,
    line: line
  )
  guard let message = failure else { return }
  XCTFail(message, file: file, line: line)
}
```

The deliver docs specify the folder names accepted [here](https://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/deliver/#available-language-codes). Let's create a function that maps a language to the folder name. Add the following snippet to `AppStoreScreenshots.swift`:

```swift
func folderName(for language: Language) -> String {
  switch language {
    case .enUS: return "en-US"
    case .enAU: return "en-AU"
    case .es: return "es-ES"
    case .pt: return "pt-BR"
  }
}
```

Now let's substitute the `assertSnapshot` function with the `saveScreenshot` function we just created:

```swift
saveScreenshot(matching: vc, as: .image(on: device), dir: folderName(for: language))
```

The final version of `AppStoreScreenshots.swift` should look like this:

```swift
import XCTest
import MyAwesomeAppFramework
import SnapshotTesting
import SwiftUI

class AppStoreScreenshots: XCTestCase {

  override func setUpWithError() throws {}
  override func tearDownWithError() throws {}

  func withEnvironment(
    _ env: MyAwesomeAppFramework.Environment,
    body: @escaping () -> Void) {
    let oldEnv = AppEnvironment.shared.env
    AppEnvironment.shared.env = env
    body()
    AppEnvironment.shared.env = oldEnv
  }

  func withEnvironment(
    userDefaults: UserDefaults = AppEnvironment.shared.userDefaults,
    language: Language = AppEnvironment.shared.language,
    body: @escaping () -> Void) {
    let env = Environment(userDefaults: userDefaults, language: language)
    withEnvironment(env, body: body)
  }

  func testScreenshots() throws {
    let userDefaults = UserDefaults()

    let languages: [Language] = [.enAU, .enUS, .es, .pt]
    let devices: [ViewImageConfig] = [.iPhoneXsMax, .iPhone8Plus]

    for language in languages {
      for device in devices {
        withEnvironment(userDefaults: userDefaults, language: language) {
          let view = GreetingView()
          let vc = UIHostingController(rootView: view)
          saveScreenshot(matching: vc, as: .image(on: device), dir: folderName(for: language))
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

func saveScreenshot(
  matching value: UIViewController,
  as snapshotting: Snapshotting<UIViewController, UIImage>,
  dir: String,
  file: StaticString = #file,
  testName: String = #function,
  line: UInt = #line
  ) {
  let snapshotDirectory = ProcessInfo.processInfo.environment["FASTLANE_SCREENSHOTS_PATH"]! + "/" + dir

  let failure = verifySnapshot(
    matching: value,
    as: snapshotting,
    record: true,
    snapshotDirectory: snapshotDirectory,
    file: file,
    testName: testName,
    line: line
  )
  guard let message = failure else { return }
  XCTFail(message, file: file, line: line)
}

func folderName(for language: Language) -> String {
  switch language {
    case .enUS: return "en-US"
    case .enAU: return "en-AU"
    case .es: return "es-ES"
    case .pt: return "pt-BR"
  }
}
```

Our test target is ready! Rerun the tests with `Cmd+U` and check the results. You should have all the screenshots generated in `fastlane/screenshots` and separated by language in folders. This is how the tree should look like:

```
├── MyAwesomeApp.xcodeproj
├── MyAwesomeApp.xcworkspace
└── fastlane
    ├── Fastfile
    └── screenshots
        ├── en-AU
        │   ├── testScreenshots.1.png
        │   └── testScreenshots.2.png
        ├── en-US
        │   ├── testScreenshots.1.png
        │   └── testScreenshots.2.png
        ├── es-ES
        │   ├── testScreenshots.1.png
        │   └── testScreenshots.2.png
        └── pt-BR
            ├── testScreenshots.1.png
            └── testScreenshots.2.png
```

### Using Fastlane To Generate the Screenshots

We have everything ready on the Xcode side, but how can we integrate the screenshot generation with fastlane? Let's start by initialising fastlane. Open your terminal, go to the project folder and run:

```
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec fastlane init
```

Choose **Manual Setup** and press enter until the setup wizard finishes. 

To generate our screenshots, we only need to run the tests on the `AppStoreScreenshots` scheme. To run our tests we can use the [`scan`](http://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/scan/#scan) action. Open `fastlane/Fastfile` on a text editor and let's add a new lane to generate the screenshots.

```ruby
desc "Generate screenshots for App Store"
lane :generate_screenshots do
  scan(
    workspace: "MyAwesomeApp.xcworkspace",
    scheme: "AppStoreScreenshots",
    device: "iPhone 11 Pro Max",
    fail_build: false
  )
end
```

We're almost there, but for scan to work, we need to make a small change on our scheme.  Open the project on Xcode, select `Edit Scheme ▸ Build` and check the checkbox for `Run`.

![scheme-build-run]({{ assets_path }}/scheme-build-run.png)

We're ready! Delete the `fastlane/screenshots` folder to make sure we are regenerating the screenshots. Then run the lane by using this command:

```
bundle exec fastlane ios generate_screenshots
```

It should generate all the screenshots.

Congratulations! You automated the screenshots generation of your app!

### Final Words

I hope you enjoyed learning how you can use a snapshot library to generate screenshots for your app page. Now you can integrate this into your pipeline and save some time.
